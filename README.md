## Description
This notebook illustrates the processing steps of the wall mask generation approach that based on multi-directional steerable filters. The input is a color floor plan image and the output is a binary wall mask image.

The methode is used for generating the wall mask images of the Versailles-FP dataset; downloadable free of charge at : https://www.etis-lab.fr/versailles-fp/en/ 

## Get started
